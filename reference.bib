             Describes a scaling model for drainage times and critical

             viscosity ratious, lambda>0.1.  Shows that coalescence may occur
             at angles>45degrees where the shear flow force is negative (pulls
             the drops apart).  Drops with surfactants coalesce slower than
             those without.  For offsets>0, the coalescence angle is often
             greater for drops with surfactants.  The critical Capillary number
             is reduced even with just a little surfactant.  For larger
